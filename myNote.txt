1. need to get pycocotools
https://github.com/waleedka/coco
then go to samples
cp -r ../../coco/PythonAPI/pycocotools pycocotools

2. download mask_rcnn_coco.h5 and put it under Mask_RCNN dir
https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/tag/v2.0
https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/download/v2.0/mask_rcnn_coco.h5

2. need to change the following setting in requirements.txt 
tensorflow>=1.13.1
keras>=2.1.0
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

3. need to command to change TF1.0 --> TF2.0 for the whole Mask_rcnn dir
https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/issues/1797
"""
First I was in the project folder, then I
cd ..
Since I don't need another backup, I use the following command, according to the help instruction.

tf_upgrade_v2 --intree Mask_RCNN --inplace --reportfile report.txt

Mask_RCNN is where I clone the whole repo.
And it works.

The following is probably not necessary
5. also changed this for "no display instance" error, but no sure it's the fix 
https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/issues/912
I've solved this problem by modifying utils.py line 866 from
shift = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])
to
shift = np.array([0, 0, 1., 1.])
It's simply a data type error which will cause float number becomes zero, leading to divide by zero error
